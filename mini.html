Hi I'm 13 and I just started watching Rick and Morty and I can tell you for a fact it's my favorite show!!. Lik the one time
Ricky said said there's probably like no good !!!! i was agreeing so much I'am smarter then you're average fidget spinner
teen at middle school to even though I have one. I may be young but I'm smarter then every theist on earth basically the
show is also really deep when they said like no one was born for a reason I was so blown away as they arent scared
to say that on tv so I told my friends on minecraft and they agree too. LOL once when my mom took me to McDonald's I asked
for the Mulan dipping sauce and the dumb girl didn't even get the reference XD One time in class i evan shouted "I'm PICKLE
RIIIICK!" and Mrs.Janice told me to go outside i reawlly hate her. School is for dumb ppl just like what Rick said,
i m too smart for such imbicells. But yeah I love Rick and Morty and I'm actually smart enough to get it to.
